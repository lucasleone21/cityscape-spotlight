# Focus Functionality Improvements - Enhanced Place Navigation

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the focus functionality in the Cityscape Spotlight application, ensuring that clicking on place cards in the sidebar properly moves the map to that location with visual feedback.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Fixed Coordinate Handling

- **Correct coordinate format**: Fixed the coordinate order issue in the focus effect
- **Proper Leaflet integration**: Ensured coordinates are passed in the correct [lat, lng] format
- **Smooth transitions**: Added proper duration and animation settings for map movements

### 2. Enhanced Focus Visual Feedback

- **Pulse animation**: Added a pulse effect to the focused marker on the map
- **Visual distinction**: Focused place cards now have enhanced styling and shadows
- **Status indicator**: Added "Map focused here" text to show which place is currently selected

### 3. Improved User Experience

- **Clear focus button**: Added "Return to City Overview" button when a place is focused
- **Smooth transitions**: Map smoothly returns to city center when focus is cleared
- **Better zoom levels**: Focused places zoom to level 16 for detailed view, city center at level 11

### 4. Visual Enhancements

- **Focused place card styling**: Enhanced borders, backgrounds, and shadows for focused cards
- **Marker pulse effect**: Temporary animation to highlight the focused location
- **Transition animations**: Smooth CSS transitions for all focus-related changes

- Place card gets enhanced styling to show it's focused

### 2. Visual Feedback
